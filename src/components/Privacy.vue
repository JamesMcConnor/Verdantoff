      functionality, analyze performance, fix errors, and improve the usability and effectiveness of the Verdantoff
      Services.
      - Recommendations and personalization. We use your personal information to recommend features, products, and
      services that might be of interest to you, identify your preferences, and personalize your experience with
      Verdantoff Services.
      - Provide voice, image and camera services. When you use our voice, image and camera services, we use your voice
      input, images, videos, and other personal information to respond to your requests, provide the requested service
      to you, and improve our services.
      - Comply with legal obligations. In certain cases, we collect and use your personal information to comply with
      laws.
      - Communicate with you. We use your personal information to communicate with you in relation to Verdantoff
      Services via different channels (e.g., by phone, email, chat).
      - Advertising. We use your personal information to display interest-based ads for features, products, and
      services that might be of interest to you. We do not use information that personally identifies you to display
      interest-based ads.
      - Fraud Prevention and Credit Risks. We use personal information to prevent and detect fraud and abuse in order
      to protect the security of our customers and others. We may also use scoring methods to assess and manage credit
      risks.</p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl">Data Retention</h2>

    <p>We retain your personal information for as long as necessary to provide the services you have requested, or for
      other essential purposes such as complying with our legal obligations, resolving disputes, and enforcing our
      policies.</p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl">What About Cookies and Other Identifiers?</h2>

    <p>To enable our systems to recognize your browser or device and to provide and improve Verdantoff Services, we
      use cookies and other identifiers.</p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl">Does Verdantoff Share Your Personal Information?</h2>

    <p>Information about our customers is an important part of our business, and we do not sell our customers'
      personal information to others. We share customers' personal information only as described below and with
      subsidiaries that either are subject to this Privacy Notice or follow practices at least as protective as those
      described in this Privacy Notice.</p>

    <h3 class="text-xl">-Transactions involving Third Parties:</h3>

    <p>We make available to you services, products, applications, or skills provided by third parties for use on
      or through Verdantoff Services. You can tell when a third party is involved in your transactions, and we share
      customers' personal information related to those transactions with that third party.</p>

    <h3 class="text-xl">-Third-Party Service Providers:</h3>

    <p>We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include analyzing data,
      providing marketing assistance, providing search results and links (including paid listings and links),
      processing payments, transmitting content, scoring, assessing and managing credit risk, and providing customer
      service. These third-party service providers have access to personal information needed to perform their
      functions, but may not use it for other purposes.</p>

    <h3 class="text-xl">-Business Transfers:</h3>

    <p>As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy other businesses or services. In such
      transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets but remains subject to
      the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Notice (unless, of course, the customer consents otherwise). Also,
      in the unlikely event that Verdantoff.com or substantially all of its assets are acquired, customer information
      will of course be one of the transferred assets.</p>

    <h3 class="text-xl">-Protection of Verdantoff and Others:</h3>

    <p>We release account and other personal information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the
      law; enforce or apply our conditions and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of
      Verdantoff, our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations
      for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.</p>

    <p>Other than as set out above, you will receive notice when personal information about you might be shared with
      third parties, and you will have an opportunity to choose not to share the information.</p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl">How Secure Is Information About Me?</h2>

    <p>We design our systems with your security and privacy in mind.

      - We work to protect the security of your personal information during transmission by using encryption protocols
      and software.
      - We follow the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) when handling credit card data.
      - We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards in connection with the collection, storage, and
      disclosure of customer personal information. Our security procedures mean that we may ask to verify your
      identity before we disclose personal information to you.
      - It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computers,
      devices, and applications. We recommend using a unique password for your Verdantoff account that is not used for
      other online accounts. Be sure to sign off when finished using a shared computer.</p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl">What About Advertising?</h2>

    <p>Third-Party Advertisers and Links to Other Websites: Verdantoff services may include third-party advertising
      and links to other websites and apps. Third-party advertising partners may collect information about you when
      you interact with their content, advertising, and services. For more information about third-party advertising
      at Verdantoff, please refer to our terms and conditions.</p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl">Use of Third-Party Advertising Services:</h2>

    <p>We provide ad companies with information that allows them to serve you with more useful and relevant Verdantoff
      ads and to measure their effectiveness. We never share your name or other information that directly identifies
      you when we do this. Instead, we use an advertising identifier like a cookie, a device identifier, or a code
      derived from applying irreversible cryptography to other information like an email address.</p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl">What Information Can I Access?</h2>

    <p>You can access your information, including your name, address, payment options, profile information, Prime
      membership, household settings, and other activity history in the "Your Account" section of the website.</p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl">What Choices Do I Have?</h2>

    <p>If you have any questions as to how we collect and use your personal information, please [provide a method of
      contact here]. Many of our Verdantoff services also include settings that provide you with options as to how
      your information is being used.</p>

    <p>-As described above, you can choose not to provide

      certain information, but then you might not be able to take advantage of many of our Verdantoff Services.

      - You can add or update certain information in the "Your Account" section. When you update information, we
      usually keep a copy of the previous version for our records.
      - If you don't want to receive e-mail or other communications from us, you can adjust your communication
      preferences in the "Your Account" section.
      - If you don't want to see personalized ads from Verdantoff based on your app activity data, you can adjust your
      advertising preferences in the "Your Account" section.
      - The Help feature on most browsers and devices will tell you how to prevent your browser or device from
      accepting new cookies or other identifiers, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or
      how to block cookies altogether. Because cookies allow you to take advantage of some essential Verdantoff
      Services, we recommend that you leave them turned on. If you block or otherwise reject our cookies, you will not
      be able to add items to your Shopping Cart, proceed to Checkout, or use any Verdantoff Services that require you
      to Sign in.</p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl">Childrenâ€™s Privacy</h2>

    <p>We do not knowingly collect, use, or disclose personal information from children under the age of 13 without
      prior parental consent, except as permitted by the Childrenâ€™s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA).</p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl">Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>

    <p>We may change our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will post any privacy policy changes on this page and,
      if the changes are significant, we will provide a more prominent notice (including, for certain services, email
      notification of privacy policy changes). We also keep prior versions of this Privacy Policy in an archive for
      your review.</p>
